# Images

This directory holds all the images in non-digital and digital form, including sources where applicable.

As part of this thesis I have created many images by hand, which I then transformed later on. The different versions generated over time are reflected in the file names (e.g. _v1, _v2).

Tools used:
- Drawio (for technical graphics)
- Google trends (for trend charts)
- Google sheets (for results)
- Google presentation (for visualizations)


## References

All images haven been created by the author. The sources for drawio images are collocated with the images in this directory. References for data used in graphics are either directly referenced in the thesis or the sources can be found in the bsc-implementation directory (e.g. for results and visualizations).
