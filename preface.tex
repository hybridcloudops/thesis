    My career in IT started almost ten years ago.
    Over the course of those years, I have worked on many applications, including ones wit low-latency, high-throughput requirements and ones distributed over the whole globe.
    As a software engineer, I always feel responsible for the whole lifecycle of my applications, including operations.
    As a result thereof, I am usually involved in defining and managing development processes.
    Interestingly, this is not the standard.
    With the DevOps movement, perception seems to change.

    It is only as part of my studies that I have been introduced to the concepts of cloud computing, despite the fact that it predates my career.
    Since then, I have worked on various private projects that make use of cloud technology.
    As access to computing resources becomes simpler, handling those resources becomes increasingly complex, making efficient management the new challenge.
    However, considering all the tooling available and the possibilities we have with virtually infinite resources, there is really no excuse for inefficiency anymore.

    Over the years, I developed a proclivity for simplicity, as in our field, I feel that people often have a tendency to overcomplicate things.
    Therefore, my personal goal for this bachelor thesis was to provide a simple solution to a complex problem.
