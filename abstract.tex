    \noindent The adoption of \gls{cloud} and \gls{devops} models is a current trend in the industry.
    As part of the digital transformation, many large enterprises start working with \gls{hybrid_cloud} environments.
    At the same time, business continuity has to be ensured.
    With the increased use of \gls{hybrid_cloud}, new challenges arise and with this trend the demand for \gls{hybrid_cloud} management solutions.
    In this bachelor thesis, a \gls{cross_cloud} management solution based on \gls{kubernetes} is introduced, which operates with tags and policies to drive deployments to configured \glspl{cloud}.
    Furthermore, it provides a way to integrate the existing software stack using the same declarative approach.
    The applicability is evaluated with experimentation in combination with an assessment by a small expert group of industry representatives.
    The results demonstrate the high-end performance of the solution and show that there is potential for such an application in the industry.
    However, further work is required to build a more comprehensive solution that fulfills the acceptance criteria of a regulated enterprise environment.
